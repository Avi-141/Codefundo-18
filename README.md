Goal : To create a robust and upgraded prediction system to predict cyclones, and build a framework that eliminates possible misuse of opaqueness of the relief fund collection system.

Abstract :

PHASE 1 : Deep learning has, in recent times,garnered enormous attention from Academia, Industry, Government and media for it's rapid success and developement in the fields of computer vision, etc. Neural networks are considered amazing functional approximators. 
Cyclones are an inherently complicated, stochastic, and noisy phenomenon. Predicting cyclones has been a problem of formidable complexity since it was sought-after. Though current techniques may involve the use of  Deep or machine learning, to predict cyclones using recorded data, our idea is to model cyclones as probabilistic phenomenon. The inherent chaos and stochasticity of cyclones makes it difficult for models to properly understand the underlying probability distribution of the data to develop a plausible model. We propose the use of Variational Autoencoders(VAE) for this purpose. VAE's have been proved to be an excellent repoitre of models to learn the underlying structure of data, and doing so well enough to generate realistic looking images from sampled points from the distribution. We use a mixture of convolutional VAE as powerful feature extractors to help us classify satellite image data into cyclones or not. The problem of predicting the path is taken care by another Generative model called Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN) to reconstruct traced data. 
We also propose the use T-SNE  algorithm to properly visualise and infer charecteristics from the cyclone dataset. 


PHASE 2: This phase of our project toys with the idea of using decentralised Blockchain technology to  create and maintain a decentralised ledger of transactions that happen during relief fund transfer. We want to increase transparency while, providing anonymity.
